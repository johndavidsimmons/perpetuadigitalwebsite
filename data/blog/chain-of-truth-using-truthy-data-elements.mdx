## The Problem

You are the admin of a large Launch property used across many different
URLs or parts of a website. Similar data points come in through different
means depending on which code base you are in, whether the URL was built by
a vendor with a WYSIWYG tool, what version of your data layer the site uses, etc.
This is a problem because you need to collect the same data points everywhere
and populate them into an eVar or XDM field, regardless of where they come from.

## Example

A real-world example of this problem, ironically, comes from a team
I'm working with that uses Adobe App Builder (was this called Firefly
at some point?). App Builder uses hashes for page routing but messes up
our email campaign query parameters, so URLs end up looking like this,
with the query string after the hash:

`https://www.example.com/someapp/#/page?utm_campaign=abc123`

This means that when my Launch property is on this page, the regular
query parameter type data element won't work because window.location.search
is an empty string due to the query string being after the hash.
So, I need to devise some logic to check both my regular parameter and,
if that is undefined, parse it from this hash. Enter the fallback.

## Using Fallbacks

Rather than writing custom code into my rule action logic, which
I will never maintain, I can use a mapping table data element to
handle this check for me. Shoutout to the creators of the mapping
table extension! I will need three data elements: `utm_campaign_parameter`,
`utm_campaign_fallback`, and `utm_campaign`.

### utm_campaign_parameter

This is my standard query parameter data element type from Launch

### utm_campaign_fallback

This is a custom code data element that parses a malformed url for
the utm_campaign query parameter. It might look something like this

```
return new URLSearchParams(window.location.hash.split('?')[1]).get('utm_campaign')
```

### utm_campaign

This is the data element I will actually use. It's a mapping table type that
evaluates the page URL. If I'm on the `someapp` domain using the example URL
above, I want to use my `utm_campaign_fallback` data element since I know
this domain has malformed query parameters. Otherwise, I will use the
`utm_campaign_parameter` data element, which should work normally on other
domains. I name this data element simply utm_campaign because that's what
it returns, regardless of the source.

This works because the mapping table evaluates in order.
If `someapp` is found in the URL, the first row returns.
If it's not found, my second, more generic case will match,
and that data element will be returned.

## Truthy Chain

The second method is for situations where things are a little murkier,
and you don't know where your data will come from. Say I need to set my
campaign parameter. It might be in `utm_campaign`, or it might be another
parameter. Maybe it comes from a data layer event or a cookie. Who knows?
Enter what I call the truthy chain.

Truthy chain data elements work like this: I take my known data sources,
order them by reliability (or just throw them all in and see which one works),
and return the first one that isn't undefined. Incorporating a truthy
chain data element into my previous example would look like this.
Assume here that my campaign variable can be in different query
parameters or come through various sources.

### campaign data element

```javascript
const campaignSources = [
  _satellite.getVar('other_campaign_parameter'),
  _satellite.getVar('other_campaign_fallback'),
  _satellite.getVar('campaign_cookie'),
  _satellite.getVar('utm_campaign_fallback'),
  _satellite.getVar('utm_campaign_parameter'),
  _satellite.getVar('campaign_from_session_storage'),
  // etc etc
]
return campaignSources.find((dataElement) => dataElement)
```

This data element will iterate through the list and return the first
truthy value (not `undefined`). This assumes my property is configured to
return `undefined` for empty data elements instead of empty strings.

So on my above example URL with the utm_campaign parameter in the hash,
the data element `utm_campaign_fallback` is the first data element that contains
a value. So the truthy chain data element will return that one. If the 'campaign_cookie'
data element was defined, the truth chain would return that one since it appears in
the list ahead of the utm fallback data element.

Using this approach in a data element keeps the "checking" logic out of
my action code and allows me to look in multiple places for the same data.
Of course, the most ideal setup would be to configure the site to send
consistent data in the same way every time, but in today's modern society,
that's not always possible.

I use this truthy chain data element paradigm a lot. Maybe I should make an extensionâ€¦
