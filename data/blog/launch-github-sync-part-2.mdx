## The Github push webhook

After the setup that I mentioned in the [first post](https://www.perpetua.digital/blog/launch-github-sync-part-1) is completed,
I can tap into the Github push webhook to kickoff the syncing between
Github and Launch. This webhook will notify my API that some file modifications have
occurred in Github and that those changes that _may_ require updates to Launch data elements.
I say _may_ here because the Github push webhook will notify me of all file modifications in my
repository and it will be up to me to determine what, if anything, needs to be synced with Launch.

The Github push webhook also introduces the first layer of security in the form of a
[Webhook secret](https://docs.github.com/en/webhooks-and-events/webhooks/securing-your-webhooks#setting-your-secret-token).
This allows me to verify calls made to the API. More on that later.

So what exactly is webhook? Off the top of my head, and by that, I according to ChatGPT, a webhook is:

> a way for two applications to communicate with each other in real-time. It is a type of API (Application Programming Interface) that allows one application to send data to \ another application automatically whenever a certain event occurs.
>
> Webhooks work by sending a notification to a URL endpoint that is specified by the receiving application. This notification typically contains a payload of data that describes the event that triggered the webhook.

In order to start receiving notifications from Github about file updates via the push webhook, I need to do 2 things:

- Build and API endpoint for the webhook to send its POST requests to
- Configure that endpoint as a webhook in my Github repo

I'll start with building an endpoint...

## My API for receiving Github push webhooks

Fortunately for me, going super in depth about building and hosting API endpoints is
beyond the scope of this little blog thing I got going. If you are new to such things, I
_highly_ suggest reading about building APIs in [Flask](https://pythonbasics.org/flask-rest-api/)
for Python (like mine is) or [Express](https://medium.com/makers-byte/building-a-restful-api-with-express-js-a-beginners-guide-dcb1a1e3520d) for Node.
Once built, you then need to host your endpoint server somwhere public so Github can access it.
Lots of options here, the most obvious (and the one I went with) AWS
[web hook gateways](https://medium.com/mindorks/building-webhook-is-easy-using-aws-lambda-and-api-gateway-56f5e5c3a596).

Below is the [Flask route](https://exploreflask.com/en/latest/views.html) for my endpoint that will
receive and handle pushes from Github. If you've never worked in Flask or made an API before, it might look a
little complicated, but it really only does a couple things. Here's the highlights

- `@verify_github_webhook_secret` is a Python decorator that makes sure any POST requests
  to this route not only come from Github, but come from me specifically.
- `modified_data_element_files` is a `list` of all the data element files that have been updated
  in this push. If there are _zero_ changed data element files, like if I updated a `README.md` file,
  the entire flow stops here. No need to sync with Launch.
- The `dict` called `data` contains all the information I will need about this push to look up the
  _actual content_ of the files. The push webhook only says that contents was modified, but not
  specifically what those modifications were.
- Finally, if everything checks out, I invoke the next Lambda in the flow which will call the github
  API to extract the specific file contents which will prepare them for the Launch API. _In my actual code
  `FunctionName` is the name of the next lambda I call._

```python
@app.route("/github-webhook-handler", methods=['POST'])
@verify_github_webhook_secret
def github_webhook():
    try:
        try:
            payload = request.get_json()
            modified_files = payload['head_commit']['modified']
            author_name = payload['head_commit']['author']['name']
            owner = payload['head_commit']['author']['username']
            repo = payload['repository']['name']
            ref = payload['ref']
        except Exception:
            return make_response(jsonify(error='Error parsing github data from request'), 400)

        # find modified data elements files
        modified_data_element_files = [
            file for file in modified_files if file.startswith("dataelements")]

        # the request was successful, no action needs to be taken
        if len(modified_data_element_files) == 0:
            return make_response(jsonify(message='No files in the data elements directory have been modified'), 204)

        # everything is good - trigger the lambda - the lambda does the launch updating!
        data = {
            "message": "OK",
            "modified_data_element_files": modified_data_element_files,
            "author_name": author_name,
            "owner": owner,
            "repo": repo,
            "ref": ref
        }

        # invoke the next lambda here
        client = boto3.client('lambda')
        response = client.invoke(
            FunctionName='some fake name here',
            InvocationType='Event',
            Payload=json.dumps(data)
        )
        # return success
        response_data = {
            "statusCode": 200,
            "body": data
        }
        return make_response(jsonify(response_data), 200)
    except Exception as e:
        return make_response(jsonify(error=f'Error {e}'), 500)
```

By far, the easiest way to create and deploy AWS Lambdas and API Gateways is through the
[Serverless](https://www.serverless.com/) framework. It takes care of the drudgery of uploading
packages to AWS and has a nicer UI. Highly recommended.

Once I get this API deployed, I'm going to have a publicly reachable route to POST to. First task complete. It is this
URL that I then configure inside of Github.

My deployed API will have a route that will look _something_ like the URL below. Notice how the path `github-webhook-handler`
is the path I defined in `@app.route` above.

`https://fakedatahere.execute-api.aws-region-name-here.amazonaws.com/github-webhook-handler`

## Setting up a Push webhook on a Github repo

Now that I have my endpoint URL all set up and running in "the cloud",
I need to tell my Github repo to post to it on Push events. To do that,
I go into my Repo and got to `Settings > Webhooks > Add Webhook`.

    The endpoint URL I made goes in `payload url` and I need to [generate a random
    string](https://www.random.org/strings/) for a secret. SAVE IT SOMEWHERE SAFE!

Once the webhook is setup, I can QA that it's working by doing some push events and
checking the **Recent Deliveries** section. If something is broken, like I pasted the wrong URL
or I don't have my secret keys setup, errors will show here.

So all this happens in an instant, but here is what happens step by step (with pictures!!!!!)
