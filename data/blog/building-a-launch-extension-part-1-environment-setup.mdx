# Intro

In my recent post about data elements, I showed how to use a concept I call the "truthy chain" where you
return the first truthy value from an array of data elements. This lets you create a sort of information
gathering priority list. For example, if my campaign value isn't in the URL, look in the data layer, then
look in a cookie, and return the first value you find. I use this setup a lot, and I like making extensions,
so here we are.

I thought this was a great idea worthy of an extension. Turns out this is already part of the Evolytics Data Element
Assistant extension. Kudos to them! I found out this information after recording the demo videos and writing this
entire blog post so I won't actually be building truthy chain as its own extension, but it wasn't all for naught,
as the information is still worthwhile to write down. Enjoy!

# Repository

# Reactor Scaffold

On this side of things, Launch is called Reactor. Adobe's Reactor scaffold tool does a lot of setup for you in
regards to folder structure. I here I make a new folder called `truthyChain` and run

```bash
npx @adobe/reactor-scaffold
```

This will walk you through a setup flow and generate the folder structure and files needed for a Launch extension.

After running Reactor Scaffold, it has generated for me an extremely basic Launch extension that will run locally
in what they call the Reactor Sandbox. Basically, a stripped down
version of Launch meant for local development of extensions. To startup the sandbox, run:

```bash
npx @adobe/reactor-sandbox
```

Reactor sandbox will spit out a url to go to see your Launch development sandbox.

# Installing Dependencies

The Reactor Scaffold tool is in need of some updating, as it generates files for you and assumes
you want to work in plain HTML and JS. I definitely don't want to do that. React is way easier, safer,
and for me faster to write. Also, I want to use Adobe's React Spectrum UI library (the same library that Launch uses)
so that I can make my extension look halfway decent.

I want to write Typescript since it's the current year and all. So I will set that up as well. I will also
need a way to compile my files from Typescript/React to the plain HTML files that the Reactor library wants. I will use webpack
for that.

The first thing to do is `init` an npm project since scaffold doesn't do this. This will give me a `package.json` file so
I can install further dependencies. The `-y` flag skips a bunch of setup questions that I either don't care about or will fill in later.

```bash
npm init -y
```

Now to install a bunch of stuff...

Here I am installing React so I can write my extension views with React components
and Typescript so I can do that with the all the benefits of TS over vanilla JS.

```bash
npm i typescript react react-dom @types/react @types/react-dom
```

Reactor scaffold won't just compile my TS files to the plain HTML it needs for views. I need to do that on my own
so enter webpack. I will show the webpack configuration a little later.

```bash
npm i webpack webpack-cli webpack-dev-server html-webpack-plugin ts-loader style-loader
```

I'm also going to include Babel here
since I think when passing settings around Reactor you need to do it in a vanilla JS file that may need to be transpiled from es6 to basic JS.
I'm not sure if I will use it yet, but just in case.

```bash
npm i @babel/core @babel/preset-env @babel/preset-react @babel/preset-typescript babel-loader
```

Usually you don't have to do all this stuff anymore since things like `create-react-app` just set this all up for you; but
since I need to compile specific things into specific directories, here we are.

## Webpack

### webpack.config.js

```javascript
const path = require('path')
const HtmlWebpackPlugin = require('html-webpack-plugin')

module.exports = {
  entry: './src/index.tsx',
  output: {
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'src/view/dataElements'),
    filename: 'bundle.js',
  },
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.(ts|tsx)$/,
        use: 'ts-loader',
        exclude: /node_modules/,
      },
      {
        test: /\.js$/,
        exclude: /node_modules/,
        use: {
          loader: 'babel-loader',
        },
      },
      {
        test: /\.css$/,
        use: ['style-loader', 'css-loader'],
      },
      {
        test: /\.(png|jpg|jpeg|gif|svg)$/i,
        type: 'asset/resource',
        generator: {
          filename: 'images/[name][hash][ext]',
        },
      },
      {
        test: /\.(woff|woff2|eot|ttf|otf)$/,
        use: [
          {
            loader: 'file-loader',
            options: {
              name: '[name].[hash].[ext]',
              outputPath: 'fonts',
            },
          },
        ],
      },
    ],
  },
  plugins: [
    new HtmlWebpackPlugin({
      template: './src/view/ViewTemplate1.html',
      filename: 'truthyChain.html',
      inject: 'body',
      templateParameters: {
        title: 'Truthy Chain Data Element',
      },
    }),
  ],
  devServer: {
    static: {
      directory: path.resolve(__dirname, 'src/view/dataElements'),
    },
    port: 3001,
    open: true,
    hot: true,
    compress: true,
    historyApiFallback: true,
    watchFiles: ['src/**/*.js', 'src/**/*.ts', 'src/**/*.tsx', 'src/view/dataElements/**/*.html'],
  },
  resolve: {
    alias: {
      images: path.resolve(__dirname, 'images'),
    },
    extensions: ['.ts', '.tsx', '.js', '.jsx'],
  },
}
```

This is my webpack configuration file. It is what makes all the modern development I show in the video possible.
Mainly building in React TS files with HMR enabled and building a .html file to a specific directory.

The important parts:

- **Loaders**:

  - Handles `.ts` and `.tsx` files using `ts-loader`.
  - Transpiles `.js` files with `babel-loader`, excluding `node_modules`.
  - Processes `.css` files with `style-loader` and `css-loader`.
  - Manages image assets (e.g., `.png`, `.jpg`, `.svg`) with hashed filenames in an `images/` folder.
  - Loads font files (e.g., `.woff`, `.ttf`) with `file-loader`, saving them in a `fonts/` folder.

- **HTML Template**:

  - Uses `HtmlWebpackPlugin` to create `truthyChain.html` from `ViewTemplate1.html`.
  - Injects the bundled script into the HTML body and sets the title to "Truthy Chain Data Element."

- **Development Server**:

  - Serves files from `src/view/dataElements`.
  - Runs on port `3001` with hot reloading, file watching, and compression enabled.
  - Supports `historyApiFallback` for single-page application routing.

- **Aliases and Extensions**:
  - Defines an alias `images` for importing files from the `images` directory in case I want to add like a demo image
  - Resolves `.ts`, `.tsx`, `.js`, and `.jsx` file extensions for module imports.

## React

This part of the setup will likely vary in a larger extension with a lots of views, but here is what works for me.
In my `src/` directory I need 2 files: `App.tsx` and `index.tsx`

### App.tsx

This file may be unnecessary at this point, but may come in handy if my extension front end grows in complexity.
This where I will return individual views wrapped in the main spectrum theme

```javascript
import { Provider, defaultTheme } from '@adobe/react-spectrum'
import TruthyChain from './components/TruthyChain'

function App() {
  const { title } = document
  return (
    <Provider theme={defaultTheme}>
      <TruthyChain />
    </Provider>
  )
}

export default App
```

### index.tsx

This is my entry point. React will inject the app into `#root` div in ViewTemplate1.html

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';
import App from './App';

// Create a root and render the App component into it
const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')!);
root.render(<App />);

```

### ViewTemplate1.html

This is the html template which all my views will use since they all need to load the `extensionbridge.js` file.
They will also receive a dynamic `title` as well. This isn't necessary since I have a single view here, but
its good to setup just in case.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title><%= title %></title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="root"></div>
    <script src="https://assets.adobedtm.com/activation/reactor/extensionbridge/extensionbridge.min.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

### package.json

In order get webpack to do its thing, I need to add some commands to `package.json`

`dev` will set up my local server where I can work on the view files directly and `build` is
for when I want to actually compile them and try them out in the sandbox.

```javascript
"scripts": {
    "dev": "webpack serve --mode development",
    "build": "webpack --mode production"
  }
```

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Conclusion

Now I can quickly build extension views using Adobe's own UI library and incorporate them into my Launch Extension!
