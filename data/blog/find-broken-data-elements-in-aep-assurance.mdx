# The AEP Debugger Extension

I am going to skim over a bit on how to use the [AEP Debugger Extension](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/experience-platform/debugger/home)
because if the title of this blog enthused you enough to make it this far, odds are you probably know how to use it already.

Basically, when QA-ing front end data of a web Launch deployment that utilizes the Web SDK you can view every request sent to the Edge
by going to

**AEP Debugger > Experience Platform Web SDK > Edge Transactions > Connect to Remote**.

Pro tip: Name your session so it doesn't get lost in the sea of unnamed sessions inside
[Adobe Assurance](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/experience-platform/assurance/home).
In the interest of continuity, assume I have already saved an AEP Web SDK debug session with Edge transaction hits to Adobe Analytics in it.

# The default validation function

You can find the Validation Editor on the side menu inside Assurance. Here you can write and save your
[own custom functions](https://github.com/adobe/griffon-validation-plugins/wiki/Writing-a-Validation-Function) to check
your session for errors/bad data/whatever else you may need to look at programmatically.

Read the docstring here at your leisure, but just know that these functions take the events from your session,
you write code to check/validate/QA them, and you return whether your validation was successful or not.

```javascript
/**
 * a Validation Plugin is a single function with the intent to validate one thing and one thing only
 *
 * @param {Object[]} events may be a subset of all the events in a session.
 * @param {string} [params] an optional parameter that a validation function can receive.
 * @returns {Object} validation - The validation result.
 * @returns {string} validation.message - The validation message to display in the results.
 * @returns {string[]} validation.events - An array of event uuids to be reported as matched or not matched.
 * @returns {('matched'|'not matched'|'unknown')} validation.result - The validation result. This should be an enumerated value.
 * @returns {ValidationResultLink[]} validation.links - An array of validation result links (see definition below).

 * A Validation Result Link * @typedef {Object} ValidationResultLink
 * @property {('doc'|'product'|'plugin')} type - plugin should navigate to other plugins; others to outside references.
 * @property {string} url.
 */
function(events, params) {
  return {
    message: 'PASSED!',
    events: [],
    links: [],
    result: 'matched'
  };
}
```

Assurance is stilled referred to as `Griffon` in a lot of documentation. It's really more of a mobile tool than a web tool.
It goes surprisingly deep for those who care to learn:

## Broken data elements in a workspace

Doing validation functions on a one off basis is usually more work than its worth. Where it does come in handy though is doing
more generic types of validations that can apply to every session. Something I definitely want to check every session
for is broken data elements making their way to analytics.

### Setting a broken data element on purpose

Here I am using a non existent data element as my eVar1 setting in an XDM data element. Maybe I didn't make it yet or forgot to add it to
my build library, regardless, since `somedataelement` doesn't exist evar1 will be set literally to `%somedataelement%`.

![broken data element](https://images.ctfassets.net/on47yk52ubpi/4iRAawJoYbFfcPpmjoMub4/cf3c1d4413db32bf31e49bfd0ed0b3b0/brokende.png)

When you see the double percentage signs in workspace, you got yourself a broken data element!
I want to find these in my session using Assurance Validation!

### Some Workspace Dashboard

| eVar1               | Occurrences |
| ------------------- | ----------- |
| %some data element% | 1029        |
| foo                 | 454         |
| bar                 | 433         |
| baz                 | 322         |

# My Broken Data Element Finder Validation Function

**NOTE: Using the validation function editor is an exercise in stoic patience. The editor is finicky and will
sometimes fail to upload, retrieve, or save your function. Always work in a separate
code editor and paste your code into the validation function window. You have been warned**

**[Github Gist for this function is here](https://gist.github.com/johndavidsimmons/fd83f54ce1093496dd3bd80c0b652a34)**

```javascript
function(events, params) {
  const processedHits = events.filter(e => e.vendor === "com.adobe.analytics.hitdebugger")
  const allEvarValues = processedHits.map(item => Object.values(item.payload.evars)).flat()
  const allPropValues = processedHits.map(item => Object.values(item.payload.props)).flat()
  const dataElementSyntaxRE = '^\%.+\%$'
  const brokenDataElements = [
    ...allEvarValues,
    ...allPropValues
    ]
    .filter(val => val.match(dataElementSyntaxRE))
  return {
    message: brokenDataElements.length ?
        `Broken Data Element: ${JSON.stringify(brokenDataElements)}` :
        'No Broken Data Elements!',
    events: [],
    links: [],
    result: brokenDataElements.length ?
        'not matched' :
        'matched'
  };
}
```

## Filtering Adobe Analytics Hits

All validation functions by default receive every event that occurred in the debug session in the form of the `events` parameter.
Depending on your implementation, this could be many hits to
different products. Since I only want to look at evar and prop values from fully processed Adobe
Analytics hits, I filter those hits out by the `vendor` key.
This makes it so I'm only working with this hits I want to validate.

```javascript
const processedHits = events.filter((e) => e.vendor === 'com.adobe.analytics.hitdebugger')
```

Next, I'm extracting the evar and props values into their own arrays. The dimension data in each hit is in nested objects and arrays, so
by flattening them I turn an array of arrays into a single array of strings. Then I merge all my evar and prop
values into a single array to inspect.

```javascript
// dimenions = [['foo', 'bar'], ['buzz', 'bazz']] flat() => ['foo', 'bar', 'buzz', 'bazz']
const allEvarValues = processedHits.map((item) => Object.values(item.payload.evars)).flat()
const allPropValues = processedHits.map((item) => Object.values(item.payload.props)).flat()
```

## Filtering for broken data element values

Now that I have all my evar and prop values for this session. I can inspect each value and
see if it matches the telltale syntax of a broken data element: a string bracketed by percentage signs.
This is a low hanging fruit QA, but its much easier and faster to find them this way than in some dashboard
a month from now.

I'm merging together my props and evars array, and searching for strings that match the data element
syntax regex and savings those matches into their own array called `brokenDataElements`.
If the `brokenDataElements` array has any values in it, this validation will not pass.

```javascript
const dataElementSyntaxRE = '^%.+%$'
const brokenDataElements = [...allEvarValues, ...allPropValues].filter((val) =>
  val.match(dataElementSyntaxRE)
)
```

## Return Values

The new validation function docstring shown when you make a new function spells out what to return.
I've deleted it here, but its helpful to keep for reference when working.
You would think something like this would be a
boolean return, but alas, you must return an object with a `result` key that has `matched` or `not matched` as a string.
Here I am using a ternary to check whether the
`brokenDataElements` array is empty. If it is, then the validation has passed. If it has values, the validation
has failed and the violating values will be logged in the message.

```javascript
return {
  message: brokenDataElements.length
    ? `Broken Data Element: ${JSON.stringify(brokenDataElements)}`
    : 'No Broken Data Elements!',
  events: [],
  links: [],
  result: brokenDataElements.length ? 'not matched' : 'matched',
}
```

There are extra steps I could take here, like adding the UUIDs of the hits where the data element syntax
was found to the events array in the return object `events` key. This time that is unnecessary since I will most likely be going
straight to Launch anyway to make my fixes. I would do that though if I were working with a very large session or my
results were somehow ambiguous.

## Validation Summary

After writing and saving the function, I can now see it in the validation summary where it can be run against any session that is recorded.
Recording a session, then looking at the validation summary, I will be able to identify broken data elements instantly.
Note the validation summary `category` is custom.

**Great Success**

There we go! Now I can record an entire analytics session and have Assurance check for broken data elements for me!
