## Corporate Chat apps and you

Here is a quick one for you all. I, like many IT professionals, am forced to use Microsoft Teams. 
Occasionally, I get a survey from Microsoft asking me how much I like Teams. To which I think to myself, 
“I have no choice in the matter”. That’s life though. We must make the best of the hand we are dealt, even 
if that hand includes sometimes letting a corporate chat app stress you out. Anyway, here’s how I use Teams rooms to save my inbox from Adobe Analytics alerts.



## Sending Adobe Analytics Alerts as to Teams rooms

Did you know you can turn anything in workspace into an email alert? Did you also know that you can send a
 message to any Microsoft Teams channel via email? Do you see where I am going here?

To get the email address of any Teams channel (are they channels or rooms? eh who cares?) hover over it 
and click on the 3 dots that come up to the right of the name. You will see an option that says Get Email Address. 
This will give you an email address for the channel. Emails you send here will show up as teams messages.
