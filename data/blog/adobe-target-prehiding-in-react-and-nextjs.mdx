## The Adobe Target/Personalization Prehiding Snippet

I did not write the code for this blog. It uses the [Tailwind Starter Blog Template](https://github.com/timlrx/tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog) which uses
NextJS, React, and Tailwind CSS. 90% of the code I will never touch. I have, however,
done some customization and deployed the Adobe Web SDK, amongst other things. Since I also
use this site as a sandbox for proof-of-concept projects in Adobe Target, I have also setup [Adobe Target prehiding](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/platform-learn/implement-in-websites/implement-solutions/target.html?lang=en#add-the-target-pre-hiding-snippet).
I need to make sure that content doesn't flicker and hinder the user experience for my 7 readers :)

I'm going to lay out how I have implemented prehiding on this site in the in hopes that it will help
others get their own setup in order. My examples here use Adobe Web SDK prehiding setup, so the code will
be a _little_ different from what is used for `AT.js`, but the concepts should be the same.

As website building tools and javascript frameworks get more complicated, placing your prehiding code has become a bespoke process.
Its even harder when you are only _kind of_ a developer like me. Telling someone _"Just put it at the top of the page"_ has sort of lost its meaning,
as most pages these days are just almogomations of React components. What even is a _page_ anymore, man? Anyway...

In the Web SDK specifically, its a challenge to have your [render personalization](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/edge/personalization/rendering-personalization-content.html?lang=en)
in sync with your data layer eventing, what is happening on your UI, and what Target is returning.

If you are using the Adobe Web SDK you can find the Target prehiding snippet in the Web SDK extension:

![prehide snippet location](https://images.ctfassets.net/on47yk52ubpi/18sQ2towWyVvysCfrb9pxZ/c9d4a59f0f4a5e8622d225ff85fed595/prehidesnippetlocation.png)

<figure>
  <figcaption>
    I have yet to figure out what the **Prehiding Style** section above the code snippet section is
    for. I mean I get what its says it will do, but I have never gotten it to really have an effect
    on anything.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

The code below is what you are copying out of the extension:

```javascript
<script>
  !function(e,a,n,t){var i=e.head;if(i){
  if (a) return;
  var o=e.createElement("style");
  o.id="alloy-prehiding",o.innerText=n,i.appendChild(o),setTimeout(function(){o.parentNode&&o.parentNode.removeChild(o)},t)}}
  (document, document.location.href.indexOf("adobe_authoring_enabled") !== -1, ".personalization-container { opacity: 0 !important }", 3000);
</script>
```

At a high level, this code gives you a class called `.personalization-container` to place on elements that may be affected by
Target/personalization efforts. This class will make elements with it are invisible (opacity 0) for 3 seconds _or_ until a personalization response
is sent back from the Adobe Edge Network.

I have _slightly_ [modified my code](https://github.com/perpetua-digital/perpetuadigitalwebsite/blob/main/components/analytics/Prehide.tsx) to
use `.prehide` as the class name instead of `.personalization-container` because the word "personalization" feels too ambitious for my little blog here.
You can see my prehide code in [my repo](https://github.com/perpetua-digital/perpetuadigitalwebsite/tree/main) under `public > static > scripts > prehide.js`
![my prehide code](https://images.ctfassets.net/on47yk52ubpi/zxfUdqX2qdFw67CdnY561/8bd95ed06a4b7a40a63f19b421098bc1/myprehidecode2.png)

<figure>
  <figcaption>
    Throw a little console log in there too just as a sanity check. I should probably make that a
    _satellite.log
  </figcaption>
</figure>

I then load `prehide.js` in my main `_app` file which in turn loads the snippet on every page load and makes my `.prehide` class available.
This method makes prehiding _work for me_, your experience may vary. By _works for me_,
I mean that it prehides my elements tagged with the `.prehide` class until my Web SDK response returns with a personalization decision.
That is exactly what the prehide snippet is supposed to do. However, this implementation method seems to go against everything the [NextJS documentation says to do
when working with external scripts](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/optimizing/scripts).
Here are the other ways I tried to incorporate this snippet before I came to this setup:

## Methods that didn't work

### React Component

First, I tried matching the original author of this template's structure of other analytics components and made a
functional react component out of it.

```javascript
import Script from 'next/script'

const Prehide = () => {
  return (
    <>
      <Script strategy="afterInteractive" id="adobe-prehide">
        {`
            console.log('begin prehide')
            !function(e,a,n,t){var i=e.head;if(i){
                if (a) return;
                var o=e.createElement("style");
                o.id="alloy-prehiding",o.innerText=n,i.appendChild(o),setTimeout(function(){o.parentNode&&o.parentNode.removeChild(o)},t)}}
                (document, document.location.href.indexOf("adobe_authoring_enabled") !== -1, ".prehide { opacity: 0 !important }", 3000);console.log("prehiding....")
        `}
      </Script>
    </>
  )
}

export default Prehide
```

This _kinda_ worked, depending on where I tried to load it. Importing into the `_app.tsx` file
with the other analytics components would yield prehiding on _some_ tagged components, but seemed
to be in a race with the hydration of the page elements.

Changing the [script strategy](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/optimizing/scripts#strategy)
had no effect. A prehidden tagged component would load, be shown, dissappear, then re-appear with test content from Target.
Good behavior, in theory, but the timing was off. I tried importing it into the [\_document.tsx file](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/custom-document), but that had no effect at all.
I believe this is because code in `_document` is not read by the browser.

### Inline Scripts

Next up was formatting the component using [NextJS inline scripts](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/optimizing/scripts#inline-scripts) formatting.
I could not get the prehiding snippet to work at all with this formatting. I don't know why. I couldn't even get console.logs to work here either.

```javascript
<Script id="adobe-prehide">
  {`!function(e,a,n,t){var i=e.head;if(i){
  if (a) return;
  var o=e.createElement("style");
  o.id="alloy-prehiding",o.innerText=n,i.appendChild(o),setTimeout(function(){o.parentNode&&o.parentNode.removeChild(o)},t)}}
  (document, document.location.href.indexOf("adobe_authoring_enabled") !== -1, ".prehide { opacity: 0 !important }", 3000);`}
</Script>
```

Using the `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` to set the prehide snippet in a `next/script` component also
had no effect on prehiding elements. I don't know why `¯\_(ツ)_/¯`

## Prehiding in Action

I have a few elements on this site tagged for prehiding. I am using the strategy of tagging individual
elements instead of entire section so as to not hinder my web vitals scores.

### Subhead

This little subheadline on the homepage is gray by default, but I use Target to turn it green. The prehiding code prevents the default one from showing before Target can do its thing.

![subhead default](https://images.ctfassets.net/on47yk52ubpi/1j34Yd1FrEPSUKr9dbNyeq/4a5c1b2a3a96c17932f617783fec3ba4/subheaddefault.png)

The profile image here has the prehiding class so you'll see it load slightly after the rest of
the content. If I had a Target activity that altered that image, the activity's content would
replace the hardcoded image seamlessly.

```javascript
<Image
  src={avatar}
  alt="avatar"
  width="192px"
  height="192px"
  className="prehide h-48 w-48 rounded-full"
/>
```

## What did I learn?

In the end, I got it to work, but I don't know exactly why. I guess what I learned here to keep trying until something works! If anyone has successfully integrated
Target prehiding into a React/NextJS app such as mine, please reach out!

Sometimes when working on this stuff I feel like JK Simmons' character in this clip
