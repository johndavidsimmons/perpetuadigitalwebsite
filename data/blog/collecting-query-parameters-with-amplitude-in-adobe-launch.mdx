## Praise for the Amplitude Launch Extension

I‚Äôve been working on a few Amplitude deployments via Launch (aka data collection tags) lately and I am a huge fan of the 
Amplitude V2 extension. It does everything the [Amplitude Browser SDK](https://www.docs.developers.amplitude.com/data/sdks/typescript-browser/)does and the documentation links in it are all correct. 
There are even code samples within the custom code sections! This fact alone saved me a ton of time when setting up my 
deployment and writing the following plugin.

Tracking an event with the Amplitude extension is pretty straight-forward. After selecting you conditions & criteria in a rule, 
you can add the *Track Event* action to send *events* and *event properties* to Amplitude.

As you can see above, with any event you can manually add properties you want to send along with it. 
That‚Äôs all fine and good, but I know I‚Äôm going to need to send any and all UTMs with every Amplitude event. 
Enter [Amplitude Plugins.](https://www.docs.developers.amplitude.com/data/sdks/typescript-browser/#plugins)

*Note: I know Amplitude grabs UTMs automatically for attribution. However, I like seeing them on my events also. 
You could also use the same plugin code I use here to automatically grab any param(s) you need and have them 
automatically added every event.*

## Writing and Adding Amplitude Plugins in Launch

For the time being, I am putting my Amplitude Plugins in the same rule where I *Initialize* Amplitude. 
I like the idea of having all the setup type stuff in the same rule. 
Also, I don‚Äôt know specifically plugins should go. Either way, this seems to work üòÅ

Inside the Add Plugin Action, click *Plugin Code*, and you‚Äôll be treated to a nice commented out code 
example and link to documentation. Very helpful!

Here is what‚Äôs going on line by line

2. give the plugin a name :)

3. Specify the type of plugin it is. This one is an enrichment plugin.

4. The setup function takes the Amplitude config, but since I don‚Äôt need to manipulate that I‚Äôm just doing a debug log and returning.

8. The execute function takes the Amplitude event as a parameter. It will look at every event that passes through Amplitude. If I needed to limit this plugin to only effect certain kinds of events (i.e. only pageviews and not logins, etc.) I could do that inside the function on the next line.

9. Grab all the query parameters of the current URL

10. Of the existing query parameters, filter out the non-UTM ones, and create and object of the ones that contain utm in their key

```javascript
// www.example.com?utm_content=ABC&foo=bar&utm_campaign=XYZ

const params = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search)
// Array.from(params) = [["utm_content", "abc"], ["foo", "bar"], ["utm_campaign", "XYZ"]]

// remove non utms and create object
const utms = Object.fromEntries(Array.from(params).filter( ([key]) => key.includes("utm")))
// utms = { utm_content: "ABC", utm_campaign: "XYZ" }
```

11. Combines any existing properties the event has with the UTM ones. If I didn‚Äôt do this, and just assigned the utm object as the event properties, it would overwrite everything that was already in there and I don‚Äôt want that. I do get a warning from Launch here for using the spread operator. I don‚Äôt know how much of an issue that will be, but its something I will keep my eye on.

12. Return the event

## In Action

You can see what Amplitude is doing using the [Amplitude Event Explorer Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/amplitude-event-explorer/acehfjhnmhbmgkedjmjlobpgdicnhkbp) (Firefox version please!)

In this case you can see when I track *myfakevent* event, the utm parameters are added, 
but the foo parameter is not! The other data from *myfakeevent* is also being passed because 
I am merging the existing event data with the utm data in the plugin code.

I am loving the plugin functionality so far and look forward to using it to make my life easier. 
Also, based on some of the _satellite logs that the extension spits out, I suspect the Launch extension itself 
is heavily integrated with Amplitude plugins. 
If anyone from Amplitude reads this, can you confirm or deny?
