## No more searching the console

Checking the console for rule "fired" debug messages can get really annoying, especially if you have a lot of rules
or if your rules have generic names. It's not just rules. I log information for myself all the time
using \_satellite.logger or, yes, even console.log from time to time. To this, I say never again. Well, not never again,
but at least not as much.

Instead of checking the console, with the newest version of the Custom Debug Logger extension, you can write toast modals that appear when rules fire.
Along with the rule name, you can include any message or data you want. Even logging the value of data elements!
What will you do with all the free time you'll save not having to search the console?
Before you ask: no, these modals won't hijack your users' experience since they only fire when debug mode is on, so your dev team can't use Launch as their personal modal builder.

If you're a purist who loves the console, I've made it at least 8% more fun for you. The latest
update to Custom Debug Logger also lets you write debug logs with custom emojis and color schemes.
Does it make your data better? Technically no, but isn't it fun to see a heart emoji in the console
as a reminder that love is the only thing that truly matters in this world? Anyway…

## How to use it

I probably don't need to spell this out, but I haven't written a blog post in like 18 months, so here we are.
Custom Debug Logger tools can be found in rule actions.
Select “Toast” or “Log,” customize to your heart's content, and check out the results.
Personally, I use this when doing QA on a flow with major milestones.
For example, a modal pops on my `scAdd` and `purchase` events and shows me the value of my products data element.
This way, I don't have to dig through the console or find it in the official debugger extension logs
which I inevitably forgot to lock to my current window anyway.

Adobe doesn't tell me if anyone actually uses this, so here's the deal:
if you comment on this post with a URL you work on that has Custom Debug Logger installed, I'll Venmo you $5. Yes, I'm serious.
