My name is John Simmons and I am a web analytics engineer from Michigan, USA.
Although I dabble in other tools once in a while, my primary focus and experience is in the
Adobe Experience Platform. I'm an Adobe Certified Developer in both Adobe Analytics and Adobe Target.

I started out putting click tags on buttons and accidentally became a "real" engineer along the way.
My goal with this blog is to prove to myself \(_or at least try to_\) that I know what I am talking about. If it helps someone
out along the way, even better!

Please reach out to me on social media if you wish to discuss any of the following topics:

- The esoteric nuances of Adobe Launch, Adobe Analytics, Adobe Target, or the Adobe Experience Platform Web SDK
- The adoption of [Esperanto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esperanto) as the world's universal language
- The raising of dachshunds
- The superiority of fly fishing to all other types of fishing
- Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu being the ultimate form of unarmed combat
