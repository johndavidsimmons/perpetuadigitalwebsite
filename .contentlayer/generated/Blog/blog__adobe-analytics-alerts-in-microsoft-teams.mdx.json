I, like many IT professionals, am forced to use Microsoft Teams. \nOccasionally, I get a survey from Microsoft asking me how much I like Teams. To which I think to myself, \n“I have no choice in the matter”. That’s life though. We must make the best of the hand we are dealt, even \nif that hand includes sometimes letting a corporate chat app stress you out. Anyway, here’s how I use Teams rooms to save my inbox from Adobe Analytics alerts.\n\n\n## Sending Adobe Analytics Alerts as to Teams rooms\n\nDid you know you can turn anything in workspace into an email alert? Did you also know that you can send a\n message to any Microsoft Teams channel via email? Do you see where I am going here?\n\nTo get the email address of any Teams channel (are they channels or rooms? eh who cares?) hover over it \nand click on the 3 dots that come up to the right of the name. You will see an option that says Get Email Address. \nThis will give you an email address for the channel. Emails you send here will show up as teams messages.\n\n![get email address](https://images.ctfassets.net/on47yk52ubpi/7ydcij9Xs1DdOEynblXfzn/e8e80e75ffbb0a3351129e7523f6afb1/Screen_Shot_2023-01-25_at_4.40.31_PM.png)\n\nCopy the email address. You’ll need it in a second.\n\nOver in Adobe Analytics, create an [Alert](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics/analyze/reports-analytics/alerts.html?lang=en). Ideas for alerts usually come to me during the trance like flow-state I \nenter whilst weaving a narrative of numbers with the loom of Workspace. When this inspiration strikes, I like to right \nclick on row in workspace and click *Create alert from selection* to bring up the alert builder with some stuff prefilled.\n\n![create alert from selection](https://images.ctfassets.net/on47yk52ubpi/7tJ8ZOEJW6LRnZjlXUJyeC/1b3209f7702d452ecf6c6406b8be161b/Screen_Shot_2023-01-25_at_4.47.00_PM.png)\n\nIn the alert builder, put the email address from Teams as a recipient. To do some quick testing, you can build \nsomething that is guaranteed to trigger immediately.\n\n![team address goes here](https://images.ctfassets.net/on47yk52ubpi/1yrTt5jJxQ2yTEhIoS2s4X/31860fd64ae6de290bdb15aef0259f07/Screen_Shot_2023-01-25_at_4.53.43_PM.png)\n\n![alert email in teams room](https://images.ctfassets.net/on47yk52ubpi/3Ku7sbHmpWWhZkraQdtkYQ/f6b514ad3c1facfea4412f6d4fc4a31b/Screen_Shot_2023-01-25_at_5.00.10_PM.png)\n\nNow when this alert occurs, I get this Teams message and 1 less email. This has the added \nbenefit of being able to notify large groups of people at once without having to add individual recipients! \nLess email for everyone!",
